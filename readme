build
=====

Minimal build tool for POSIX systems, designed to be simple & straightforward,
while still being familiar and easy to learn. The file format is based on two
simple sections: the options & targets. To whet your appetite, here is an
example:

	cc          gcc
	src         src/*.c
	flags       -I./include
	out         program

	@install    mv -f program /usr/local/bin

As you can see, this buildfile is used to compile a project with C sources in
src/ and header files in include/. The `out` option is the name of the output
file, which then can be installed using `build install`. For more information
you can install build and read the manpage with `man 1 build`.


Install
-------

This project has no dependencies, the only thing you need is the standard C
library along with POSIX headers and a sane compiler.

	$ su -c target/bootstrap.sh
