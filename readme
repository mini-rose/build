build
=====

Minimal build system designed specifically for C. I was fed up with all these
verbose & over the top build scripts (and God forbid, CMake!), so I had to
build my own.

The main goal of this build system is to have a minimal build file. I may not
enjoy having a build file in my project but I understand it's required to
atleast define the compiler or include paths.


How to use
----------

In order to use this tool, just run `build` (if installed) on a C project. It
will build the project with the default settings, so the first available
compiler will be used on anything that ends with '.c'. It's that simple.


Build & install
---------------

If you want to install it globally, run as root (sudo, doas, ...).

    $ sh ./install.sh



Other
-----

`build -v` will always return an integer which represents the actual version of
the tool. You may use this to compare against if you're looking for some feature
that is only available from a perticular version.
